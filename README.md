MathGames

In this repository, I am going to store all of my beginner projects, mainly containing Math Games. These files are accessed by the MathHub Launcher.
Feel free to test my programs and get better at Math!

If you want to play any of these games, just download the launcher located at MathGames/launcher/MathHubLauncher.exe and execute it. Allow the computer to run this program (Virus Scan)
and double click it. The rest (Setup, folders, files, etc.) the program will do itself. Everytime I upload changes, the launcher will notice it once opened and automatically updates the launcher and the updater.
If an update for a game is available, just click on "Update" in the Launcher when hovering over the Game Button. Now, glhf!
