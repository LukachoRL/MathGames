Launcher Update Version 1.2

-> Added Options Button for setting the language
-> Language updates for both MathTrainer and MathFinder

MathFinder is finally out of early access!

Some finetuning still needs to be done, but overall,
everything is done. Settings are now available (still
pretty limited options still though) and language
support is now granted.

Language Settings have been moved from MathTrainer to
the Launcher. Every game within the launcher automatically
changes the language according to your settings.




For further information, check the changelog window in
the launcher to find out about the newest changes as
well as explanations for both MathTrainer and
MathFinder.


Keep your eyes open for future updates, and stay tuned!

the launcher to find out about the newest changes as
well as explanations for both MathTrainer and

Language Translation is only available for MathTrainer
at the moment. I am working on a universal solution for
this so the language is managed by the launcher itself
in the future.

Keep your eyes open for future updates, and stay tuned!
