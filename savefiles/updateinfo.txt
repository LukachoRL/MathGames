Launcher Update Version 1.1:

-> Link added to online database (view version window
   in launcher (clickable link)
-> Added support for MathFinder 1.0 (Prototype)

MathFinder Version 1.0PT now available!

Since this game is still in production, only basic
features are available at the moment. This will change
soon. The app/game will support additional modes soon.



For further information, check the changelog window in
the launcher to find out about the newest changes as
well as explanations for both MathTrainer and
MathFinder.


Language Translation is only available for MathTrainer
at the moment. I am working on a universal solution for
this so the language is managed by the launcher itself
in the future.

Keep your eyes open for future updates, and stay tuned!
