Important note:

It can happen that your Computer tries to stop the launcher
from being downloaded or executed. This is because files
created like mine look like Malware for the PC. However, if
you want the launcher and the games to properly run, make
sure to grant the file every permission it needs.
Note that the launcher (on initial setup or open in a new
directory) automatically creates all the necessary folders
and files required (this includes the directory for update logs,
games, and update files as well as the launcher updater itself.
Updating the launcher also deletes the old file and installs the 
new launcher accordingly.
Hence, the creation and deletion process causes AntiVirus
Software to block the file.
